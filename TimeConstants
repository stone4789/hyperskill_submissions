/*
There are special types of classes called Constants or Utility which have only static fields and/or methods. Usually, such classes cannot be instantiated directly and they are only needed to group related static members to be used by other classes.

In this exercise, you will work with TimeConstants class that stores several time constants for seconds. You need to add two static fields SECONDS_IN_DAY and SECONDS_IN_WEEK and print them in this order, each of them on a new line.

        System.out.println(TimeConstants.SECONDS_IN_DAY);
        System.out.println(TimeConstants.SECONDS_IN_WEEK);

final class TimeConstants {
