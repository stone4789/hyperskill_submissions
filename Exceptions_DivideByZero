/*
Avoid division by zero
Here is a program that reads numbers and performs some calculations. It outputs the result to the standard output.

In some cases, the program will throw an ArithmeticException. Fix the program so that it prints "Division by zero!" instead of this exception.


Sample Input:
5 2 0 1

Sample Output:
2
