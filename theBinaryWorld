/*
In this stage, you'll learn how to convert each character of a string into a binary form. Any ASCII character has a size of 7 bits; in binary, the form is 0 and 1. For example, the character A has a decimal value of 65. The binary representation is 1000001. b is 98 in decimal or 1100010 in binary. The space character is 32 in decimal value or 0100000 in binary.

In this stage, you will learn to represent characters in binary form.

Objectives
In this stage, your program should:

Read a string from a console. The input contains a single line.
Print The result: line, followed by each character of input on a separate line, formatted as <char> = <binary value>.
Note that the binary representation must be 7-bit, even if the first digits are zeros. The Integer.toBinaryString() and String.format() methods can help you with that.

Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

Input string:
> One

The result:
O = 1001111
n = 1101110
e = 1100101
Example 2:

Input string:
> 123

The result:
1 = 0110001
2 = 0110010
3 = 0110011
Example 3:

Input string:
> Who am I?

The result:
W = 1010111
h = 1101000
o = 1101111
  = 0100000
a = 1100001
m = 1101101
  = 0100000
I = 1001001
? = 0111111
