/*
Write a program, which reads the number of direction (1 – up, 2 – down, 3 – left, 4 – right, 0 – do not move) and outputs the text "move up" (or "move down", or "move left", or "move right", or "do not move" depending on the entered number). If it is a number that does not belong to any of the listed directions, the program should output "error!"

Note: the output text should exactly match the sample, including the letters’ case and location of spaces.


Sample Input:
1

Sample Output:
move up
