/*
You are given a class named Application.

Implement an instance method run(String[] args) that takes an array of strings and returns nothing. The method should output all the strings in the array, each on a new line.

Let's consider the example. Suppose the run method is invoked with the following argument: ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]

In this case, the method's output will be:

arg1
arg2
arg3
*/

import java.util.Arrays;

class Application {

    void run(String[] args) {
        // implement me
        Arrays.stream(args).forEach(arg -> System.out.println(arg));
    }
}
