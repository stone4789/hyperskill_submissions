/*
Shapes area
You have five classes: Shape, Triangle, Circle, Square, and Rectangle. The class Shape has a method area(). This method does nothing. Override the method in all subclasses. Overridden methods should return an area of a particular figure. Use class fields for this.

The area of a triangle is S=bh/2 where h is the height of the triangle, b is the base of the triangle.

The area of a circle is S=πR2 where R is the radius of the circle. For π use the Math.PI constant.

The area of a square is S=s2 where s is the length of the side of the square.

The area of a rectangle is S=wh where w is the width of the rectangle and h the height of the rectangle.
