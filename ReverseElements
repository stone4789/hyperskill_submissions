/*
In this task, you need to implement reverseElements method. It should reverse all rows of the twoDimArray as in the example below.

0 0 9 9              9 9 0 0
1 2 3 4 will become: 4 3 2 1
5 6 7 8              8 7 6 5
It is guaranteed that twoDimArray has at least 1 row.

P.S. You don't need to print anything in this task or create a new array: just modify the existing twoDimArray.
